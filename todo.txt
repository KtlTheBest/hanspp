- Make sure that class Memory.Pointer has a null pointer.
  Check that it works well (crashes when it is used.)
  Add errors to the pointer type.

- Code block operations. Substitution on code blocks.
   (Needed for translation) 

- Test an array example. 

- add a primitive print operator, add a printstring operator. 
   (Not realistic but useful.)  

- Allow for global variables? We decided not. 

- conv should become a unary operation. Implement generic unary operation.

- Check that the simulator works with SSA. (done) 

- Reconsider the implementation of VarStore. Maybe it should not compute 
  sizes of types by itself.  

- Add a for loop, add a revfor( ) loop. Translate them into 
  while loops in the translateStatement( ).

- Explain the definitions, that we are not using them.
