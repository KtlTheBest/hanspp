Differences between Java and CPP:

- Java has a built-in string type. In C++, strings are second class.

- The fact that you cannot catch exceptions that are not thrown is
  irritating. Similarly, forbidding unreachable code is irritating.
  It makes it hard to make quick changes in code for trying out things. 

- The java documentation on docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html
   is very convenient

- Inheritance is easier in Java. In C++, you have to write a wrapper class,
  or use a smart pointer.

- The rule that classes in the top level cannot be accessed
  from packages is unacceptable.

- Same for the rule that closures cannot throw, I removed all of them. 

- Absence of default constructors is irritating.

- Java has no auto variables, no implicit type conversions.
