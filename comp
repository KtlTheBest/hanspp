Differences between Java and CPP:

- Java has a built-in string type. In C++, strings are second class.

- The fact that you cannot catch exceptions that are not thrown is
  irritating. Similarly, forbidding unreachable code is irritating.

- The java documentation on docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html
   is very convenient

- Inheritance is easier in Java. In C++, you have to write a wrapper class,
  or use a smart pointer.

- The rule that classes in the top level cannot be accessed
  from packages is unacceptable.

- same for the rule that closures cannot throw.
